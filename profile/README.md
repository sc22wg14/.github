#  The C Standards Committee

This is the Official GitHub repository of the C Standards Committee.
The [Committee’s website](https://open-std.org/) contains the document log, meeting information, and other vital information for individuals and organizations wishing to participate in the C Standardization process.

The offficial name of the C standardization group is ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14, usually shortened to WG14.
However, the first standardization effort was by X3J1I Technical Committee under project 381-D by ANSI
on Computers and Information Processing (X3). 
Before that was book The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, which is also considered to be an informal standard.
And even before that, Dennis Ritchie and his coworkers were working on C at the Bell Labs from AT&T.
There is K&R C, ANSI C, and currently ISO C – a precedence of change is established in this matter.
Therefore, to best reflect past, present, and whatever the future holds, it is probably for the better to try
using "C Standards Committee" whenever possible, unless precision is required.

## Standard Revisions

As per the multiple agreements during Committee meetings, as well as discussions on mailing list, the names
of each revision are not directly derived from the full name of the document specifying them, nor from the
year it was published, nor even necessarily from they year the work on them was finalized.

## The C Logo

Traditionally, the logo of C language is uppercase letter ’C’ in font Helvetica Black,
first used on the cover1 of the book The C Programming Language (K&R).
Usually colored in shades of blue and grey like Hit Grey , Cadet Grey , or LightSteelBlue.
[SVG file](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg&oldid=724712962) uploaded to Wikimedia Commons for public domain by Cobaiahackers on 2023-01-12.
Beside the traditional logo, various other stylizations of letter C can be found.
Most noticeable example is a derivative of C++ logo with "++" removed, and sometimes with blue colors
either lightened, darkened, or shifted towards violet spectrum.
While some may prefer it to the traditional one, its usage is not recommended.
Even if C was lacking an established logo, and [acquired permission](https://isocpp.org/home/terms-of-use) from Standard C++ Foundation
to use one based on their design, the author(s) of the derivative work are not know.
Another issue rises from existence of similar fan-made creations for different languages that are not affiliated with each other,
nor have particularly much in common beside taking inspiration from C and C++, the strongest being the name.

while the letter 'C' alone is within [public domain](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg&oldid=968318500), the full cover graphic might meet threshold of originality for copyright
protection; in either case, the stylized letter is plenty sufficient, and full cover would be "noisy" and harder to fit into iconography
copy of the file attached to this PDF document as nota bene, established before C++ (C with Classes) was even conceived, let alone its logo
like for C-- or C# (although the latter sometimes has wandered into official communication)

## Learning C

There are a number of books and courses available to help you learn the C language.
